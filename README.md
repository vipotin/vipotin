### Hi! I'm Vilma. Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a DevOps consultant. I like to explore tooling and frameworks to solve problems and improve agility. As I continuosly face new technology and tools in my work, I want to understand how they work. Thus, I have created small projects to get hands-on experience. Here are some topics that I've worked with:

- Infrastructure as Code
  - [Terraform-Heroku](https://github.com/vipotin/terraform-heroku-deployment)
- Fullstack development
  - [Board game search](https://github.com/vipotin/board-game-search)
  - [Fullstack course](https://github.com/vipotin/fullstackopen20)
- UI/UX
  - [Experience design with Pepper robot](https://github.com/Vera-D/UXbotz)
  - [AdobeXD design](https://github.com/vipotin/AdobeXD-project)
- Docker
  - [Weather app exercise](https://github.com/vipotin/weatherapp)
